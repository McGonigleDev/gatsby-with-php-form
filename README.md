# Gatsby PHP form 

In order to send emails with PHP you will need a local web server on your computer with a solution like XAMPP. If you have a LAMP stack server then you can deploy directly on your server.

## Quick start for Gatsby

Use form-A example component.

1. Replace the email address in this [php file](https://github.com/frankagathos/gatsby-with-php-form/blob/master/api/contact/config.php) with your email.
2. Replace the URL endpoint in the [form-A component](https://github.com/frankagathos/gatsby-with-php-form/blob/master/src/components/form-A.js) to the directory you plan to deploy the API folder to.
3. Create a static Gatsby build using  **npm run build** or **gatsby build**.
4. Deploy Gatsby static app and API folder to match the endpoint in step 2.

# Quick start for any React application

Use form-A example component.

1. Follow steps 1. and 2. from above.
2. Add the [form-A component](https://github.com/frankagathos/gatsby-with-php-form/blob/master/src/components/form-A.js) in your app.
3. Add the api folder in the same directory you deploy your app.

More examples with hooks and front-end and back-end validation soon to come!
