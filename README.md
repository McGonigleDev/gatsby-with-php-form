## Gatsby PHP form 

In order to send emails with PHP you will need a local web server on your computer with a solution like XAMPP. If you have a LAMP stack server then you can deploy directly on your server.

2. Setup your API endpoint URL in form-A component found inside the components folder.
3. Create a static build using Gatsby **npm run build** or **gatsby build**
4. Deploy Gatsby static app and API folder to match the endpoint in step 2.
